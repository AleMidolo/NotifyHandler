# NotifyHandler autonomous team

This repository is the source of truth for all agents. Chat history may provide context, but requirements, interfaces, decisions, and work ownership must be reflected here before implementation depends on them.

## Global operating rules

Before starting work, every agent must inspect the current repository state, relevant documentation/specifications/ADRs, open issues and PRs, CI state, and recent commits. Do not duplicate work already implemented or covered by an active issue/PR.

Agents may make ordinary decisions within their role without requesting user approval. Use branches and pull requests for implementation work once the repository is bootstrapped. Keep changes scoped, testable, and documented.

Correctness and safe failure take priority over automation speed. Bookmaker automation must stop rather than guess whenever event, market, line, or outcome identity is uncertain.

## Non-negotiable transaction boundary

NotifyHandler may navigate, locate, verify, and select the requested betting outcome. It must not:

- capture, store, or enter bookmaker credentials;
- automate MFA or CAPTCHA;
- bypass authentication, anti-bot, rate-limit, geo, or access controls;
- enter or change stakes;
- submit, confirm, place, or finalize a bet;
- trigger deposits, withdrawals, or other financial transactions.

Authentication, stake entry, review, and final submission remain manual user actions.

## Roles

### Product Coordinator / Technical Project Manager
Owns roadmap, backlog, milestones, acceptance criteria, product documentation, issue decomposition, dependency ordering, product maturity/release-scope distinctions, and cross-agent handoff.

### Software Architect
Owns deployment model, component boundaries, shared interfaces, browser-automation architecture, adapter contracts, state model, ADRs, and architecture reviews.

### Notification & Domain Engineer
Owns input normalization, deterministic parsing, domain types, validation, recommendation-order preservation, automatic primary-option resolution inputs, and conversion to execution plans. Does not own bookmaker-specific DOM logic.

### Bookmaker Automation Engineer
Owns bookmaker-specific adapters and worker-owned live mappings that open pages, locate event/market/outcome, verify identity and odds, select the outcome when every deterministic gate passes, and fail safely otherwise. Live validation must use permitted normal-browser interaction only and must not bypass access controls or rely on protected/private APIs.

### Application Engineer
Owns the end-user application and orchestration from notification receipt through automatic primary-plan creation, automatic two-leg startup, independent status tracking, mismatch/auth/odds handling, safe recovery actions, observability, and manual-user handoff. Parsed previews/target displays are non-blocking and must not introduce a normal pre-execution choice/confirmation/start gate.

### QA / Integration Engineer
Owns contract, integration, regression, resilience, qualification, and end-to-end tests, especially automatic-start behavior, wrong-market prevention, partial failures, odds mismatch, login pauses, live-support qualification, and manual transaction-boundary protection.

### Security & Compliance Engineer
Owns credential isolation, browser isolation, untrusted-input hardening, privacy/logging, dependency security, transaction-boundary enforcement, and the threat model.

### Release / DevOps Engineer
Owns reproducible development setup, CI/CD, browser/runtime dependencies, packaging, build artifacts, signing/release gates, provenance/SBOM/checksums, rollback, and distribution according to the architecture decision.

## Coordination protocol

- Prefer one issue per independently reviewable outcome.
- Issues must state owner role, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and verification expectations.
- Architecture decisions that affect multiple agents require an ADR or architecture-doc update before downstream implementation relies on them.
- Shared contracts should be stabilized before multiple bookmaker adapters are built.
- Bookmaker integrations are incremental; do not implement all bookmakers simultaneously.
- A bookmaker is not `Supported` merely because fixture tests pass; follow `docs/bookmaker-support.md`.
- If a requirement changes, update repository docs/specs first.
- When work exposes a new blocker or requirement, create/update an issue rather than leaving it only in chat.

## Current priority order

Milestones 0–5 are complete for the unsigned local-preview MVP. Current sequencing is:

1. #43 — validate/implement narrow live SISAL support;
2. #44 — validate/implement narrow live BET365 support;
3. #45 — QA-qualify the combined initial live-supported pair;
4. #46 — prepare a signed Windows production release candidate;
5. only then expand notification transports or additional bookmakers unless product evidence explicitly reprioritizes the roadmap.

If live interaction cannot satisfy deterministic matching and access-control constraints, record the affected scope as `Blocked` rather than weakening safety rules.

## Definition of done

A change is done only when its acceptance criteria are met, relevant tests pass, documentation/specs are synchronized, safety boundaries are preserved, and no known blocker remains hidden from the repository. Preview/testable status must never be represented as production/supported status without satisfying the documented gates.
